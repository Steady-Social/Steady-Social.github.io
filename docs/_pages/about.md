Steady.Social was created from a desire to have a social network that was less about interacting with strangers and continuous engagement, and more about:

* Keeping in touch with friends and family
* Minimizing the amount of time spent on the app
* Minimizing the ability for misinformation to spread or "go viral"
* Eliminating the advertisement and data-selling aspects of social media

With these goals in mind, Steady.Social ends up being more of an "online pen pals" platform or the reading of a daily newspaper that happens to be about your friends and family than it is a place for constant online engagement.  And we hope that this alternative approach to keeping in touch with friends and family is and will continue to be both a compelling and freeing experience.

It began as a side project in late 2021, and launched with an early but functional set of features in April 2022.  Our [core values][core-values] continue to guide our design today.

You can check out our [Roadmap][roadmap] to see where we're planning to take the site in the future, and we welcome any [feedback][feedback] - be it bug reports, new features, or suggestions for future improvements!
