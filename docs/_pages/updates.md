# 1.0.1 - High pri bug fixes, 2022-05-04

* Incoming invites now show the user's real name (Note that sent invites will not and never will: I don't want to open an avenue where people can go "real name fishing" by sending invites to email addresses of people they don't know)
* I believe that I have fixed the scrolling stutter issues on the activity feed.  Let me know if you still encounter them!

# 1.0.0 - Initial Release, 2022-04-26

The initial launch of Steady.Social!

* Basic daily posting and feed updates
* Friends and invites
* User blocking
* Basic profile management
* Linking to external messaging
* New User wizard
