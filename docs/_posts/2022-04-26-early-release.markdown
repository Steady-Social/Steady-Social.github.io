excerpt: Let's talk about what features and improvements are coming up for Steady.Social now that we've launched!
---
Early release is underway for Steady.Social!  Big thanks to everyone who is currently trying it out, and an extra big thank you to those of you who are [providing feedback][feedback] about improvements you'd like to see and bugs you've run into!

Over the next few months, I hope to release many new feature for the site while still keeping to our [core values][core-values] of being a site that you should only visit once a day:

*Image uploading support*, so that you can associate your daily update with a single, meaningful image if you choose to do so.

*In-app replies to posts*, so your feedback is always in context (but still just between you and the person who posted the update!)

*Better and more intuitive invitations*, moving over to an invitation code system for users who aren't already members of Steady.social, to make it easier to understand how the invitations work and what your next steps are to bring your friends over.

*Optional "Relationship Reminder" features*, to help you remember to contact your friends directly if, like me, you find that it's easy to forget to call in a busy world!

*Posts targeted to specific 'circles' of friends*, so that more sensitive updates can be limited in scope to the people that you want to see them amidst your larger friend group.

*More login options*, including a more traditional email and password-based login, so that you don't have to sign in through Google if you want to avoid them.

I hope that these upcoming features are exciting, and that you'll get good use out of them!  I'm looking forward to our slow social future!
