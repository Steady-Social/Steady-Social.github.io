excerpt: Beginning to work through our backlog of needed features.
---
After taking some time off of development to get some rest (and to set up our LLC, which is hopefully a temporary holdover on the way to our long term goal of turning this into a nonprofit organization), I am resuming development (as before, in evenings and on weekends... so development will likely go slowly, but will edge ever forward).

To this end, we have [created a roadmap][roadmap] with our current priority for feature development.  We'd [love your feedback][feedback], as it will directly influence the order in which we implement these features!

I am excited about these features, and I hope that you will as well!  Please check out our [roadmap][roadmap] and let us know what you think!
